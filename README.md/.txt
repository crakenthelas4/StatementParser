A. Refine HDFC parser: improve patterns (transaction extraction, robust fallbacks, OCR support for scanned PDFs). I’ll expand transaction table extraction and show how to output CSV of transactions.

B. Implement second bank parser (SBI) fully — so you have 2 working banks.

C. Add automated bank detector improvement — build a small heuristic classifier using keyword scoring + first-page logo detection (text-based).

D. Add simple Streamlit UI that lets you upload a PDF and displays parsed JSON and a small spending chart.

E. Create demo video script + README + 1-page PDF report that you can submit (I’ll write the script lines and steps to record).

F. Polish project for GitHub: add LICENSE, .gitignore, richer README, sample outputs, and CI test (unit test for parser).

G. All of the above in sequence (I will do them one after another). — If you pick G, I’ll begin with A immediately.
